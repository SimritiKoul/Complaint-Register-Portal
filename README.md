# Complaint-Register-Portal
This program is designed I such a way that the users can put forward their complaints against any nearby construction, the contractors can view the complaints against each project and even register a new project or update the existing project’s status, and the admin can approve or reject the project the contractor has applied for approval.
When first the program is executed, the homepage shows 3 options – User, Contractor and the Admin. When we click on user, we can select the nearby construction against which we want to report a complaint and then write the complaint in the text box given.
When we go back to homepage by clicking the home button on top right corner and select contractor, a login page will appear where the contractor can login. The contractor can then view the complaints registered by users against each construction project. The contractor can also update the status of any of the existing projects as well as register new projects.
When we go back to homepage and select admin, the login page appears where the admin can login. The admin can view the construction projects, their status and under which contractor they are being constructed. Then the admin can approve or reject the projects.
